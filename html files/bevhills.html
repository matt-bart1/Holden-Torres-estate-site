                    <p>Beverly Hills is truly a jewel in the crown of Los Angeles and the real estate market is never anything short of exceptional. Communites that are abundant in architectual masterpieces are abundant, the quality of life is second to none and the residents include hollywood stars, entrepeneurs and high profile individuals. </p>
                    
                    <p>Settled in 1838 by Maria Rita Quinteros de Valdez (an Early California feminist icon) and her husband, beverly Hills has always been a epicenter of progress in Los Angeles. Bought in 1900 by Burton Green and partners to find oil, they reorganised as the rodeo land and water company and hired the landscape architect Wilbur D Cook who created the curving streets that hug the hills that are now synonymous with the neighbourhood. As well as this the Beverly Hills Hotel was built in 1912 and it quickly became a symbol of the areas glamourous image </p>

                    <p>Attracted by the lifestyle that the area promised, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickord led a wave of movie stars that moved in and built their own stylish mansions. Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Gloria Swanson were some of the most high profile residents of the time and a whos who of hollywood have clamoured to find their eden there ever since.</p>
