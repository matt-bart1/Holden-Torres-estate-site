                        Malibu is named for the Ventureno Chumash settlement of Humaliwo which translates to "the surf sounds loudly"
                        and that could not be anymore fitting. With its miles of breathtaking beaches, lush rolling hills and a laid back lifestyle, malibu has been a long coverted area for people looking to reconnect with nature in the business hub of Los Angeles
                        
                        <p>Surrounded by the Santa Monica Mountains Malibu was for the longest time very sparsely populated, indeed for a long time the majority of Malibu was owned by Fredrick and May Ridge. After Fredricks death in 1905, May fought furiously to maintian its privacy but unfortunately that was an impossible dream. Despite Her constant lawsuits, injunctions and walls, the U.S Supreme Court agreed the goverenment had the right to build a highway through the property in 1923. The highway opened Malibu up to development and it quickly became an area of privacy for hollywood stars. Anna Q Nilsson was the first to arrive then the likes of Gary Cooper and Clara Bow quickly followed  </p>
                    

                    <p>Malibu has maintained that aura of an exclusive retreat from the hustle and bustle of life that nowhere elese in los Angeles can offer and therefore is an area that is in constant demand. Malibu is the embodement of our mantra "find your eden".</p>
