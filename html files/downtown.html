                    <h1>On the rise</h1>
                    <p>Downtown Los angeles is currently experiencing a huge revitalisation.
                    From its early years as a Spanish and Mexican Settlement, Downtown Los Angeles has always been a hub for commerce and culture in both the local and national psyche </p>
                    
                    <p>Since 1920 downtown Los Angeles has always been a focal point for residental and business developers, Its municipal and private rail lines were some of the most comprehensive in the world and broadway, whilst always a mecca for the entertainment industry has also been one of the worlds most glamourous shopping areas. After its decline after world war 2 the Community Redevelopment Agency undertook the Bunker Hill Redevelopment project in 1955 which ensured the area was revitalised and business some came pouring back and has held steady to this day.   </p>

                    <p>Now Downtown is being revitalisated again. High end boutiques, luxury hotels and museums such as the Broad Museum is transforming the area again and therefore ensuring it is a highly sought after destination. Older buildings are being renovated into residential loft spaces and storefront units. Despite this, Downtowns legacy is preserved with landmarks such as the Bradury building and Cliftons Cafeteria</p>
